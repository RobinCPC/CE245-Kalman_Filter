\noindent {\bf Problem 1}. A stochastic process is defined as
\begin{equation}
 x_{k}=x_{k-1}+m_k,\ \ \ x_{0}=0
\end{equation}
where the random variable $m_k$ is defined by the probability density function $p(m_k)$
\begin{equation}
  p(m_{k}) \sim \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
       0, \ \ \ m_k < -1/2 \\
       4(m_k+1/2), \ \ \ -1/2 \le m_k < 0 \\
       2-4m_k, \ \ \ 0 \le  m_k \le 1/2 \\
       0, \ \ \ \ m_k > 1/2 \\
    \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
which is presented in the figure below. Find the expected value $E\{x_k\}$ and 
the variance $E\{(x_k-\overline{x}_k)^2\}$ of this process.

\noindent {\bf Problem 2} (only for graduate students) It is known that if 
$x$ is a random variable with a pdf $p_x(x)$, i.e., $x \sim p_x(x)$,  
and $y$ is a random variable $y \sim p_y(y)$, then 
$z=x+y$ is a random variable $z \sim p_z(z)$, where $p_z(z)=p_x(x)*p_y(y)$. 
The symbol  $*$ denotes the convolution, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  p_z(z)=p_z(x+y)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty p_y(z-x)p_x(x)dx
\end{equation}

(a) If $m_k \sim p(m_k)$, where $p(m_k)$ is depicted  in
 the figure, and $m_k=n+h$, figure out $p_n(n)$ and 
$p_h(h)$. 

(b) Use your conclusion from (a) to write a MATLAB code that
generates the sequence from Problem 1. Generate the sequence 
100 (or more) times and based on these sequences, verify the
results obtained in Problem 1.
